## HPM APPS announcements
- HPM APPS should be used in conjunction with HPM SDK, and the versions of HPM APPS and HPM SDK correspond one-to-one. Please refer to [Usage Instructions](hpm_app_instruction_zh) for details.
- In order to better serve users, the HPM APPS software API has specially added Chinese notes, which often cause garble due to character encoding problems when opened, so it should be opened with **uft-8** character encoding format for reference.
